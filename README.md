Uses of the Project:
Entertainment & Leisure: A simple and fun game for users to pass the time or challenge their friends.
Learning Platform: Acts as a great tool for beginners to understand the basics of front-end development and logic implementation.
Skill Testing: Can be used in programming interviews or coding bootcamps to test logic and UI skills.
Portfolio Showcase: A classic project to demonstrate frontend development skills in a personal or professional portfolio.

Significance of the Project:
Foundation Project: It introduces essential programming concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditionals, loops, and state management.
User Interaction: Demonstrates how to create dynamic and interactive web experiences.
Problem-Solving Skills: Helps strengthen logical thinking and algorithm design.
UI/UX Principles: Involves design thinking for user-friendly layout and responsiveness.

Future Scope of the Project:
Single vs AI Mode: Add a mode where users can play against a computer using algorithms like Minimax for unbeatable AI.
Multiplayer over Network: Enable users to play against others online using WebSockets or other real-time communication tools.
Leaderboard & Authentication: Allow user login and store scores in a backend database (e.g., using Firebase or MongoDB).
Mobile App Version: Convert the app into a hybrid or native mobile app using React Native or Flutter.
